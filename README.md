# Querinator

Querinator querinates you. What? Querinates? That's perfectly cromulent.
In any case it will ingest structured text, style(s) TBD, and quiz the user.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'querinator'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install querinator

## Usage

As of today, if you run bin/querinator it will ask you a meaningful question. That's it.
