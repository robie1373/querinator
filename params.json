What? Querinates? That's perfectly cromulent.\r\nIn any case it will ingest structured text, style(s) TBD, and quiz the user.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'querinator'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install querinator\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAs of today, if you run bin/querinator it will ask you a meaningful question. That's it.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
